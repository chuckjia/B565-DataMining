# B565 Data Mining (Spring 2018)

This repository holds my code for the homework assignments from the course "B565 Data Mining" in Spring 2018.

* `B565_Documentations`: This folder contains documentations on the code, including instructions on how to run the code. It also holds my written solutions to the homework problems.

* `B565_ProblemDescriptions`: Descriptions and instructions for the homework problems can be found in the 5 `.pdf` files here.

* Other folders are the code for specific problems. For example, the folder `B565HW2Prob3` has the code files for Problem 3 in Homework 2. There are in total 5 homework assignments and 1 final projects.

To run the code in this repository, it is highly recommended to check out the corresponding files in `B565_Documentations` and `B565_ProblemDescriptions`.
